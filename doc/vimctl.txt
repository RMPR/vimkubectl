*vimctl.txt*	Manage Kubernetes resources from Vim

INTRODUCTION                                    *vimctl*

This plugin defines a set of commands and mappings for viewing, editing and
managing Kubernetes resources.

This plugin assumes that the user is logged in to the Kubernetes cluster using
`kubectl` or a similar command.

COMMANDS                                        *vimctl-commands*

:KGet {resource}                                *:KGet*
			Open a split that displays a list of all resources that
			match {resource}. If {resource} is not given, pod is
			used.

MAPPINGS                                        *vimctl-mapping*

These mappings can be used on the split buffers created by |:KGet|.

i                                               *vimctl_i*
			Edit the manifest(in yaml) of the resource under the
			cursor.

CONFIGURATION                                   *vimctl-configuration*

                                                *g:vimctl_command*
Vimctl uses the `kubectl` command for communicating with the cluster. Use the
`g:vimctl_command` variable to specify a different command.
For example, to use OpenShift's `oc` command: >

    let g:vimctl_command = 'oc'
